Problems of English language
Each learner has his own issues but the most common that I felt in my students are the following:-

 

1. Lack of vocabulary.

2.Grammar .

3.Correct pronunciation.

4.Hesitation in speaking.

 

If we come to solution it will be easy to discuss it in the same sequence.

 

1.To improve vocabulary read an English language Newspaper. Reading habit will improve not only your vocabulary but also the sense of making sentences.

2.Gramar is not essential to learn a language but it is very basic to correct your language. Therefore, a Grammar book will be very helpful during the learning process.

3.Listening an English channel will improve pronunciation skills. Some English cartoons are very helpful due to pace of speaking in them. Different characters speak very slow and you can understand every word they speak and it makes easy for you to correct your pronunciation.
